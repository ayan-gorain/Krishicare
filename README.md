KrishiCare is an Artificial intelligent model based on a CNN Deep learning approach. It works as a one-stop solution for identifying unknown leaf types and detects any type of disease that might be present in that leaf. This helps to detect and treat diseased plants on time. This can be very much useful for preventing loss in nurseries or gardening-related businesses. KrishiCare can also be utilized by the common man for taking care of their in-house gardens. Some of its prominent features include Disease Alert, Plant Rescue, Plantpedia, and Plantabitat. PlantCare has an expected efficiency of 60-80%, which can be further improved by increasing the picture quality.
